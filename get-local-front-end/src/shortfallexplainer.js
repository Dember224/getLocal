      Shortfall is our way of saying that a candidate out-spent their contributions.
      This isn't necessarily the same thing as campaign debt as there are several ways to generate a shortfall. A person could, for example be independenly wealthy and financing their campaings out of pocket rather than through donors.
      Taken with other information shortfall can be helpful in determining who is struggling to cover their expenses.
